# learning-journal-basic
Build an online learning journal using Python!

Mockups have been prepared using bootstrap for the following pages:

 - *main.html* - home page that shows a list of journal entries with just the title and date created.
 - *detail.html* - detail page that shows a single entry. The title, text and created date should be displayed on this page.
 - *new.html* - HTML form page you will use to create a new entry. The title and text of the entry are inputs of the form, empty at first.
 - *edit.html* - HTML form page you will use to edit an existing entry. The title and text of the entry are inputs in this form.

*style.css* has been prepared for the styling of each of the 4 pages.

The learning journal is deployed on: https://claires-learning-journal.herokuapp.com/ utilizing Pyramid.
